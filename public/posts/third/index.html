<meta name="description" content="Before the Coffee Gets Cold ‚òïÔ∏è¬†  by Toshikazu Kawaguchi
Toshikazu Kawaguchi&rsquo;s¬†Before the Coffee Gets Cold¬†is a tender, introspective novel that offers a unique twist on the concept of time travel. Set in a cozy, almost magical caf√© in Tokyo, this book weaves together heartwarming and bittersweet stories of love, regret, and the complexities of human relationships.
The novel centers on Funiculi Funicula, a small caf√© that allows its patrons to travel back in time‚Äîbut with strict and peculiar rules. For instance, the traveler can only meet someone who has visited the caf√©, and they must return to the present before their coffee gets cold. These limitations, rather than being frustrating, add a poignant layer to the narrative, emphasizing the importance of living in the moment and cherishing the time we have.">

  "articleBody": "Before the Coffee Gets Cold ‚òïÔ∏è¬†by Toshikazu Kawaguchi Toshikazu Kawaguchi‚Äôs¬†Before the Coffee Gets Cold¬†is a tender, introspective novel that offers a unique twist on the concept of time travel. Set in a cozy, almost magical caf√© in Tokyo, this book weaves together heartwarming and bittersweet stories of love, regret, and the complexities of human relationships.\nThe novel centers on Funiculi Funicula, a small caf√© that allows its patrons to travel back in time‚Äîbut with strict and peculiar rules. For instance, the traveler can only meet someone who has visited the caf√©, and they must return to the present before their coffee gets cold. These limitations, rather than being frustrating, add a poignant layer to the narrative, emphasizing the importance of living in the moment and cherishing the time we have.\nKawaguchi introduces us to a cast of characters whose lives intersect in meaningful ways: a woman seeking closure with her lover, a wife desperate to reconnect with her husband, a sister yearning to meet her sibling one last time, and a mother hoping to embrace a child she never had the chance to know. Each story is imbued with deep emotion, resonating with themes of loss, hope, and acceptance.\nThe prose is simple yet evocative, painting vivid pictures of the caf√©‚Äôs unique ambiance and the emotional journeys of its visitors. Kawaguchi‚Äôs writing is at its best when exploring the inner conflicts of the characters, making their decisions and revelations feel authentic and relatable.\nWhile the book‚Äôs episodic structure and occasionally repetitive narrative might not appeal to everyone, these elements reflect its origins as a stage play. Rather than detracting from the experience, they create an almost meditative rhythm, inviting readers to pause and reflect alongside the characters.\nBefore the Coffee Gets Cold¬†is more than just a story about time travel; it is a gentle reminder of the importance of facing the past, embracing the present, and making peace with what cannot be changed. It is a heartfelt and uplifting read that lingers in the mind long after the final page, much like the comforting aroma of a freshly brewed cup of coffee.\nRating: 4.5/5\nThis book is perfect for readers who enjoy reflective, character-driven stories with a touch of magical realism.\n",
