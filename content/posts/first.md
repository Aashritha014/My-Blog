Hi, I'm Aashritha a CS undergrad who's mostly intrested in computers and super fast cars(tu tu tu du 🦁). 

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I can talk about all the stuff that gets me excited—whether it’s breaking down complex computer science concepts or getting into the high-speed world of Formula 1. 


Honestly, my goal? Just to yap about the things I love. I’m here to share my thoughts and hopefully spark some fun conversations. I don’t have any grand plans to change the world (though, who knows?), I just want to geek out and maybe get you as excited about these things as I am. If you’re into the same stuff, mail me! If not, I hope at least I can entertain you with my yap session.
